Like a fancy book cover, they are attracted to your first few impressions, without knowing how you might be like underneath. Leverage on this to make a strong first impression.\

        If a contact is attracted to your Month Branch, this can be interpreted as the person being attracted to how you are like at work, your working style and career-related pursuits. In other words, the energy you portray in a work setting. These are people you can leverage for your own career pursuits since they are likely to say yes.\

        If a contact is attracted to your Day Branch, this can be interpreted as the person being attracted to your core, how you are like as a person. This might have a romantic connotation, where they are attracted to the energy you portray in a romantic setting, as a close partner. Otherwise, they just generally like you as a person, which sometimes require no reason.\

        If a contact is attracted to your Hour Branch, this can be interpreted as the person being attracted to your mindset, way you think, or legacy. It could also represent your subordinates as work, or more generally the energy you portray to people, assets and things under your care.\

        If you do not have natal chart peach blossom elements, don't fret. You still have dynamic luck pillars where these peach blossom elements can come in and boost your attractiveness.\

        If you also don't have dynamic luck pillars, you can still leverage on Bazi to learn what attracts different people, and use that on them, (similar to the 5 love languages). Sure, others might have this easier, but Bazi just represents potential power. These skills can still be learned after birth."),
