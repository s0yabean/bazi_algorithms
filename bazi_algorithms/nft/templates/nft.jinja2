    <b>The BaziVerse</b> represents the infinite cycle of spacetime, combining AI algorithms with traditional alchemy. 
    Since Ancient China, the 5 elements have been a focal point of Chinese Metaphysics - water, wood, fire, earth and metal. 
    <br>
    <br>
    After generations of study, these 5 elements were further melded to form 60 distinct energy pillars. Based on stars in the solar system, these pillars are believed to represent all matter in our universe. 
    <i>Can these 60 energies really map everything in existence?</i>

      Astrology Charts As Art
      </span>
      <br>
      <br> 
      <span class="text-lg">
      Typical astrology charts are too cryptic for the layman, usually filled with complex characters, confusing arrows and symbols. 
      <br>
      <br> 
      The associative nature of Bazi can cause people to take readings too literally - usually out of context. 
      Focus is placed on understanding the underlying energy signature, instead of actual events that result. 
      Good and bad are relative in  the eyes of nature, hence the popular saying “there is a silver living that comes with every situation”.
      <br>
      <br> 
      With <b>The BaziVerse</b>, viewers can simply enjoy the visual ectasy of brillant colours in each pillar, focusing on the beauty in each individual, each experience, each moment.
      <br>
      <br> 
      In Chinese Metaphysics, one's Bazi chart depicts their fate - external energies they are influenced by for life. How one responds to such energies is their character. Together, fate and character make up one's destiny.
      With understanding and acceptance, there is always a possibility of rewriting our destiny (改运) .

      Abstract Composition
      </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="text-lg">
      Merging style transfer with color fields, <b>The BaziVerse</b> juxtaposes our seemingly chaotic universe with timeless laws and experiences. Using explosive colours and vibrant palettes, it provocatively pushes the hidden themes of life to the front.
      <br>
      <br>
      Colours representing each of the 5 elements are generously used, showing the range of personality, depth and detail each energy signature can have. Some energies are loud, bold and fiesty, while others are darker, mysterious and whimiscal. Each has their own appeal, their own unique take to every situation.
      <br>
      <br>
      Like the flash of life before death, going through the 60 energies can be a reverberating experience. The ups and downs of the past. Forgotten memories relived once again. The key event that eventually was your turning point. The unpredictable cogs of nature where only change is constant, yet predictable in the rotations of time.
      <br>
      <br>
      These energy pillars are all around us - not just in art but in personalities, objects we create, experiences we build, styles we live. <b>The BaziVerse</b> shows the world through my eyes.

    Cyclical Time in Pillars
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    A traditional Bazi(八字) reading reads a person's fate, fortune and fatalities using your birth time. Chinese astrologers believe that unlike sequential time, time goes in cycles of 60 - 60 years, months, days and even hours. 
    This cyclical pattern is mapped to 60 elemental pillars each with 2 chinese characters, representing the Heavenly Stem (天干) and the Earth Branch (地支) that together, depicts an energy signature (象) used for divination.
    <br>
    <br>
    For example, a water tiger (壬寅) pillar contains the core elements of water and wood, and can be visually represented as a vibrant rainforest, like the Amazons. The energy signature is enigmatic, lush and dark. This pillar also represents the energy for the year 2022, where themes surrounding this energy will rise to our attention.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    Compare this to the energy of 2020, a metal rat year which can be visually represented as a crystalline sword trapped in ice. In chinese medicine, metal represents the lungs and respiratory system. The water energy of the rat creates cold energy that allows organisms like viruses to thrive, and is also associated with the emotion of fear.
    To top it off, China has historically faced wars, famines and natural disasters during metal rat years, and 2020 was no different, starting the COVID pandemic in Wuhan which would serve as a great turning point in our collective history.

      Each Bazi chart is made up of 4 pillars, representing the year, month, day and hour when someone was born. Among the 4 pillars, the day pillar (top row, 2nd from left) is most associated with our underlying character, the self. This chart belongs to someone born on 2 Feb 1995 between the hours 3-5am.
